## How can I use it?
MVG Screen is distributed as a portable jar-File, which is a platform-universal Java program. You can run it in the terminal by passing over the desired stop as an argument:
```
java -jar mvg-screen.jar Ostbahnhof
```

*The program is not associated with Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft or SWM München in any way and is a private project.*
